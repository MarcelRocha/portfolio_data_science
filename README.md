* ## Projects
    * [Predicting Math Scores for Enem-2016](https://github.com/MarcelRocha/portfolio_data_science/tree/master/enem_regression): A model to predict the math marks of the national exam Enem which enable a student to apply for a spot in several public and private universities in Brazil. This was a challenge to apply for the 2 month Aceleradev - Data Science program offered by Codenation and sponsored by several companies. I achieved a R2 of 0,988 and a score of 93,37% in the challenge I took part, I used the Random Forest Regressor algorithm.
    
    * [Supervised Learning: Testers in Enem-2016](https://github.com/MarcelRocha/portfolio_data_science/tree/master/enem_classification): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether a student took the Enem exam only to test his/her skills. The model has an accuracy of 99,73%.
 
    * [Insights: CO2 Emissions](https://github.com/MarcelRocha/portfolio_data_science/tree/master/Insight_co2_emissions): Exploratory analysis of CO2 emissions in the Southeastern Brazil between 2012 and 2019.
    
    * [Implementation of a credit risk system](): It classifies the risk of giving a loan to a certain client. (on going)
    
    * [Customer Segmentation and Recommendation System](https://github.com/MarcelRocha/portfolio_data_science/tree/master/recommendation%20system): Customer segmentation of different portfolios based on a clients database, using K-means algorithm, and recommendation of new clients to each portfolio using KNN algorithm.
    
*Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib*
