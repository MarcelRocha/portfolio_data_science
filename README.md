# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.*

* ## Machine Learning
    * [Predicting Math Marks for Enem-2016](https://github.com/MarcelRocha/portfolio_data_science/tree/master/enem_regression): A model to predict the math marks of the national exam Enem which enable a student to apply for a spot in several public and private universities in Brazil. This was a challenge to apply for the 2 month Aceleradev - Data Science program offered by Codenation and sponsored by several companies. In this challenge I got a mark of 93.87.

    * [Supervised Learning: Testers in Enem-2016](https://github.com/MarcelRocha/portfolio_data_science/tree/master/enem_classification): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether a student took the Enem exam only to test his/her skills. 

    * [Supervised Learning: Credit Base](): Determining if a client should or not get a loan based on a credit history data base.

*Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib*
