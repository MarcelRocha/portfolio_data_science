# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.*

# Contents

* ## Projects
    * [Predicting Math Scores for Enem-2016](https://github.com/MarcelRocha/portfolio_data_science/tree/master/enem_regression): 
      
      * This competition was promoted by CodeNation.dev, it is a training program for technology professionals. For 10 weeks, developers and data scientists have access to challenges and content to acquire and practice the technical skills most used by technology companies around the world.

      * The objective of the competition was to predict the grades of the math exam. In this competition my model reached a score of 93.37% using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm.

      * The data provived was of the ENEM 2016, the standardized Brazilian national exam, which evaluates high school students in Brazil.
    
    * [Supervised Learning: Testers in Enem-2016](https://github.com/MarcelRocha/portfolio_data_science/tree/master/enem_classification): 
      
      * Part of the Data Science program promoted by Codenation.dev.
      
      * The objective of this challenge was to use supervised learning to predict whether a students are taking the test only to test their skills in Enem 2016 being classified as " Treineiros".
      
      * In this project, it was tested several supervised learning algorithms where the Random Forest Classifier performed best.
      
      * My score in the challenge was 99,73 and it matched with it's accuracy.
      
      * It was also implemented a code to automatic evaluate the models and use only the best one. 
 
    * [Insights: CO2 Emissions](https://github.com/MarcelRocha/portfolio_data_science/tree/master/Insight_co2_emissions):
      
      * This is a brief study about the CO2 emissions in southeastern Brazil between 2012 and 2019.
      
      * This dataset was retrieved at Brazilian Open Data Portal in the [Energy Sources section](http://dados.gov.br/dataset/fontes-energeticas).
     
    * [Customer Segmentation and Recommendation System](https://github.com/MarcelRocha/portfolio_data_science/tree/master/recommendation%20system): 
     
      * The purpose of this product is to provide an automated service that recommends leads to a user given their current customer list (Portfolio).
      
      * The project is split in two parts: Data cleaning and Recommendation System.
      
      * Data cleaning: the data of the market base data set was analysed and cleaned for a further implementation of the model.
      
      * Recommendation System: in this part, it was used the algorithm k-mean to cluster the clients of each Portfolio and then recommend new leads based on each cluster using the Knn algorithm. The clustering helped to make the project faster. But the validation metrics still need some work to undestand if the project was fully successful.
    
*Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib*
