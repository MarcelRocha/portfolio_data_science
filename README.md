# Contents

* ## Machine Learning
    * [Predicting Math Marks for Enem-2016](https://github.com/MarcelRocha/portfolio_data_science/tree/master/enem_regression): A model to predict the math marks of the national exam Enem which enable a student to apply for a spot in several public and private universities in Brazil. This was a challenge to apply for the 2 month Aceleradev - Data Science program offered by Codenation and sponsored by several companies. In this challenge my score was 93.36%.

    * [Supervised Learning: Testers in Enem-2016](https://github.com/MarcelRocha/portfolio_data_science/tree/master/enem_classification): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether a student took the Enem exam only to test his/her skills. 

    * [Insights: CO2 Emissions](https://github.com/MarcelRocha/portfolio_data_science/tree/master/Insight_co2_emissions): Exploratory analysis of CO2 emissions in the Southeastern Region of Brazil between 2012 and 2019.
    
*Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib*
